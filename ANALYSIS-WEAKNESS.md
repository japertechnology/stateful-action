# Weakness Report

## Security

### Unsanitized inputs allow command injection
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Files/Locations**: main.js (lines 5-27), post.js (lines 5-29)
- **Description**: User-provided inputs such as `INPUT_BRANCH` and `INPUT_BACKUP` are interpolated directly into shell commands without validation or quoting. A malicious value could break the intended commands and execute arbitrary code on the runner.
- **Recommendation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs before using them in shell commands. Prefer `child_process.spawn` with argument arrays to avoid shell interpretation.

### Force push can overwrite remote history
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Files/Locations**: post.js (lines 14-23)
- **Description**: The post step performs a `git push -f` to the state branch without safeguards. This force push can unintentionally replace existing history, potentially losing data or enabling malicious rewrites.
- **Recommendation**: Avoid force pushes or implement checks (e.g., verifying ancestry) before overwriting remote history.

## Interface

### Deprecated Node runtime
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Files/Locations**: action.yml (line 20)
- **Description**: The action specifies the `node12` runtime, which is end-of-life and no longer receives security updates on GitHub Actions.
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade to a supported runtime such as `node20` or `node16` to receive security patches and compatibility updates.

### Lack of validation for numeric input
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected Files/Locations**: post.js (line 17)
- **Description**: The `INPUT_BACKUP` value is used in arithmetic without ensuring it is a valid non-negative integer, which can cause runtime errors or unintended behavior if a malformed value is provided.
- **Recommendation**: Validate that `INPUT_BACKUP` is a positive integer before using it and handle invalid values gracefully.

## Code Quality

### Non-standard shebang in scripts
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected Files/Locations**: main.js (line 2), post.js (line 2)
- **Description**: Embedded shell scripts begin with `#/bin/bash -e`, lacking the `!` in the shebang. While the scripts are executed via `bash`, the incorrect header may confuse readers and tooling.
- **Recommendation**: Use a correct shebang (`#!/bin/bash -e`) or remove it since the script is executed through `bash -e` in the JavaScript wrapper.

### Assumes `.gitignore` file exists
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected Files/Locations**: main.js (lines 11-15)
- **Description**: The script runs `grep` on `.gitignore` without checking if the file exists, which causes an error in repositories without this file and halts the action unexpectedly.
- **Recommendation**: Check for the existence of `.gitignore` before grepping or provide a clearer error message when the file is missing.

## Design & Architecture

### Heavy reliance on shell scripts embedded in Node.js
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected Files/Locations**: main.js, post.js
- **Description**: Large shell scripts are embedded as strings in JavaScript and executed via `exec`, mixing languages and making the action harder to maintain and test.
- **Recommendation**: Break the shell logic into separate script files or reimplement the functionality directly in Node.js with proper libraries.
